## About Django LMS

**Django LMS** is a full-stack learning management system built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

This project provides a strong foundation for building educational platforms with user authentication, profile management, and course handling—all built with reusable Django components.

Django takes the hassle out of web development by offering:

- A clean and powerful ORM for database operations
- Built-in authentication and permission system
- Class-based views and generic CRUD operations
- Easy-to-use admin panel
- Secure and scalable architecture
- Rich ecosystem of reusable apps

Django LMS is ideal for building custom e-learning solutions, portals, or internal training platforms with modern web features.
