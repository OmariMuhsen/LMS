About Django LMS
Django LMS is a full-stack learning management system built with Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

This project provides a strong foundation for building educational platforms with user authentication, profile management, and course handling—all built with reusable Django components.

Django takes the hassle out of web development by offering:

A clean and powerful ORM for database operations

Built-in authentication and permission system

Class-based views and generic CRUD operations

Easy-to-use admin panel

Secure and scalable architecture

Rich ecosystem of reusable apps

Django LMS is ideal for building custom e-learning solutions, portals, or internal training platforms with modern web features.
